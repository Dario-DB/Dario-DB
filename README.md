Hi there👋

I am a programming and data analysis enthusiast😍💻. I am currently learning web programming with Java, Spring, HTML, CSS, Java Script and other tools, languages, frameworks and libraries. I'm also interested in big data and cloud.

In my GitHub profile you will find projects of various kinds and with different technologies. In this way, I will improve my technical skills and I hope this will be reflected in future projects💪📈.
